**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
The Air Quality Prediction Project is a machine learning-based solution aimed at forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using environmental data such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. By training regression models on historical datasets, the project enables accurate AQI predictions and classification into categories like Moderate, Unhealthy, or Hazardous. It also involves data preprocessing, encoding of categorical variables like season and country, and feature analysis to identify key pollution factors. An interactive Streamlit web app allows users to input real-time environmental data and receive instant air quality insights, promoting awareness and preventive actions.

 **REQUIREMENT**
- Python 3.10
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
